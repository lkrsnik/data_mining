Bank Asset Management Company (BAMC) has announced it would appeal to the decision of the district court, which temporarily invalidated the ownership takeover of Sava Turizem.

The Slovenian bad bank has expected its decision of taking over the ownership of Sava Turizem, tourism-oriented subsidiary of Sava Holding, BAMC's debtor, to be disputed in court and has prepared for that. It intends to appeal to the court's decision, said Torbjörn Mansson, CEO of BAMC.

Mansson is convinced that bad bank is well prepared for legal proceedings. The temporary injunction that BAMC received on Friday morning is being reviewed, said the CEO at the international conference on the economic challenges of Slovenia.

Mansson: Nothing is wrong with our procedures
According to Mansson, the court has issued a temporary injunction to protect the previous owners, as bankruptcy would be irreversible. However, considering the proposal for a compulsory settlement, which BAMC filed on Monday, this is no longer a matter of concern, pointed out Mansson, who believes there is nothing wrong with the actions taken by the bad bank.

For now, the only consequence is that there will be no preventative restructuring of Sava. From BAMC's point of view, the main aim is to improve the assets by investing in them. In Mansson's opinion, this cannot happen today or tomorrow or next week, but it is important to carry it out in two to five years, as the bad bank intends – this plan has not changed, argues the CEO, who has also emphasized that the legal dispute is nothing unusual and that it would have no impact on business operations of the hotels.
