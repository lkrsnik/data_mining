English fans are still seething over their football team’s dismal performance against Ireland (0:0) in a friendly in Dublin.

England manager Roy Hodgson said he would remind his players “of their responsibilities”, hoping this would boost their morale ahead of Sunday’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia.

England have a maximum 15 points in Group E, while Slovenia is tied with Switzerland for second place at the halfway stage in the group fixtures. In November, Slovenia and England already squared off at Wembley. Slovenia took the lead after Henderson attempted to clear Andraž Kirm's cross, but instead headed the ball into his own goal. However, England scored three goals and Hodgson’s men won 3:1. Danny Welbeck, who is the top scorer overall with six goals (two against Slovenia), will not be fit for the match in Ljubljana.

Thousands of English fans are set to travel to Slovenia to see the match. There are 3.000 seats available for visiting supporters. Five thousand English people are expected to come to Slovenia, and many of them will stay in Slovenia for the long weekend. A few tickets are still available.
