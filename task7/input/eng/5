Robert Berić, striker from Krško, is the Slovenian football discovery of the season, and an ace to be used against England as well.

No Slovenian had ever held such a high place among the most efficient football players of Europe. Presently Berić is eleventh on the list of strikers for the prestigious Golden Shoe; if we disregard the coefficients for the toughness of the league in which goals were scored, the number of goals he scored in the first league makes him eighth in Europe. Robert Berić substantially improved, and set a new scoring record of Slovenian footballers playing abroad – he scored 27 goals, and added six assists at 33 matches of the Austrian championship. His performance for the Rapid Wien team in the 2014/2015 season can be considered a dream come true for this 23-year old football player from Krško.

The Slovenian selector Srečko Katanec does not hide the fact that the first Slovenian attacker remains Milivoje Novaković, but Berić was given the opportunity to prove his top shape. "I am strong and fresh, and motivation is never a problem when playing against England," Berić claims.

Could Slovenia place for Euro 2016 directly? "I think the second place is realistically achievable, but we would need good luck as well to get it. We are expecting the second part of the qualifications with optimism," Berić replied.
