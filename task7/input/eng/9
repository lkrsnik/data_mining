The FMR financial firm will be a responsible strategic owner of Delo, which has been recognized as a wise investment. The president of the FMR management, Andrej Kern, said the company would finance the purchase of Delo with its own funds.

Kern reminded at a press-conference that FMR sees Delo as a long-term investment. As the new owners, FMR will support the development of the newspaper publisher from a strategic, staff and technological point of view.

At the same time FMR expects profitable business results from the Delo management, which was also one of the main reasons for the purchase. "We're not tycoons and we won't destroy everything," Kren assured.

Paid out 7,3 million
FMR paid 7,3 million euros for the 100 percent share of Delo. According to Kern, as a financially stable owner, FMR will ensure good working conditions for the Delo managers.

The head of the FMR supervisory board, Stojan Petrič, assesses the investment as a good buy and said the company was interested in Delo in the long run.

The purchasing agreement, signed last week, has several suspensive conditions.

Nataša Luša, a board member of the FMR firm, presented some of the suspensive conditions for which the company was reponsible. FMR already has the consensus of the supervisory board, but still needs to get consensus from the Competition Protection Agency.

The other suspensive conditions have to be fulfilled by the seller, the Pivovarna Laško brewery.
