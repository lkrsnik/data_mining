"Disconnected"

Something's crept in under our door
Silence soaking through the floor
Pinching like a stone in my shoe
Some chemical is breaking down the glue
That's been binding me to you

Oooh ooh ooh

I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been wrong so many times
We walk in circles
The blind leading the blind

Well I thought that love watched over this house
But you're boarding up the windows now
We've been leaning on each other so hard
Tied so tight we wound up miles apart
Making simple things so hard

Oooh ooh ooh

I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles
The blind leading the blind
We've been disconnected somehow

There's an invisible wall between us now
But I've been wrong and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles
The blind leading the blind

I see the landscape change before my eyes
The features I've been navigating by
No nothing looks the way it did before
I don't know where to look or what to look for

I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles
The blind leading the blind
We've been disconnected somehow

There's an invisible wall between us now
But I've been wrong and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles
The blind leading the blind
We've been disconnected somehow

There's an invisible wall between us now
