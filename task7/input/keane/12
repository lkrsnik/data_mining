"Your Love"

I didn't want to go
Go back and look for you
But it's a heartless drug
I'm addicted to

And when I drive that road
And start to feel that chill
I think I see your face
Do you come here still?

Those were the times and these were the places
Your love was so good
And now that I'm here, I suddenly find that I'm tumbling backwards

I'm back to where I was before
Dreaming of glory and your love
And now I'm lying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love

The chemicals react
And molecules collide
The poison works its way
Somewhere down inside

When we were young I really believed
Love would never leave us
But time has a knack of pulling the rug out
From underneath us

And nothing matters anymore
I'm still a victim of your love
And now I'm banging on your door
Tumbling backwards with your love
Over and over in your love

I know they're only ghosts
And memories that I'm clutching at
Maybe I'm reaching back
For something I never had
Still it seems so real to me
These ragged threads
That lead me back to you

I'm back to where I was before
Tumbling backwards at your love
And now I'm lying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love
and the other dreams we had
Fractioned and frozen with your love

You put a spell upon me there
Never be broken in your love
Nowhere to run to but your love
Over and over in your love
