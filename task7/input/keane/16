"The Starting Line"

This town was a lovers stage, but now you can’t recognize
The street lights that are daggers to your eyes

You can’t find your bearings, you’re slipping into the ground
This scene has no color and no sound

You still believe in me, after the things I’ve done,
You fear for what we have become

The ground is uneven, we stumble from day to day
Took shelter where it’s easy,
I know your feet are like lead but you’ve gotta get on the way.

Drag your heart up to the starting line,
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It’s too easy to get left behind.
I know you’ve been kicked around,
But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me

Each heart is a paper kite blown around by the breeze,
But love won’t rest till it brings you to your knees.

Some find it easy, some will never even know,
You think you’ve done your journey
Then you stumble and burn but there’s such a long way to go.

Drag your heart up to the starting line
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It’s too easy to get left behind
I know you’ve been kicked around,
You wanna be lost and not be found,
Let’s take the back way into town
And drink to the bad times, lay them down on me.

Girl I still believe in you, you’re too good to fall so low
We’re gonna find a better life I know
Things will be clearer, and soon as we make a start,
We’ll be that much nearer
We’re too old to just stand here waiting to break apart

Drag your heart up to the starting line
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It’s too easy to get left behind,
I know you’ve been kicked around
But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me, on me, on me.
