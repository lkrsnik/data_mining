"Better Than This"

Is this what you meant?
Is this
What you dreamed of?
When you were making
Your plans
Shaking the dirt off?
Do you feel like you
And I belong?
(Oh, ah, oh)
Just keep your eyes
On the road
And nothing can go wrong

You could do so much
Better than this
You could do so much
Better than this

I've been checking my sums
Oh where did the time go?
Holding my photograph up
To the window
Through the paper
A refracted sun
(Oh, ah, oh)
I can see all the things
I wish that I'd done

You can hang your hopes
On the bedsits masses
You can put your faith
In the foreign
You can tell yourself
You can do your best
You could do so much
Better than this

Get a grip on yourself
Get a grip on yourself
Could have been something
But you're too late
And you
Wouldn't want it anyway

Just a photograph
From the wrong time
'Cause there
Is no soap star
Holding your hand
You can see yourself
In a freeze-frame
Must be someone else
Using your name

And everyone
Will be the same
And everyone will __
And everywhere
You'll see your name
In every shop window

It's better than this
You could do so much
Better than this
You could do so much
Better than this
You could do so much
Better than this
