"You Don't See Me"

Like beautiful dawns, all made up and bright
Radiant people, in splintering light
All moving at the speed of life
Reflecting in each others' eyes
But you're moving so fast
Through this beautiful scene
You don't see me
You don't see me

Oh truly we are, a fortunate few
Who turn on your axis, revolve around you
All spinning outwards from your sun
Passing your reflection on
In your hurry to grasp
Everything you see
You don't see me
You don't see me
You don't see me
No, you don't see me

Such a beautiful view
I guess you've seen it all
But you
You see nothing at all
Such a beautiful view
Shining so bright

Shining so bright
So bright

All moving at the speed of life
Reflecting in each others' eyes
But you're moving with such irresistible speed
You don't see me
You don't see me
You don't see me
No, you don't see me
No, you don't see me
Oh oh...Oooo, ooo...
